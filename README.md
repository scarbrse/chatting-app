how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->

I think that attention to detail definitely makes or breaks a program. I have a tendancy to leave out little details that end up affecting my code tremendously, so I think I just need to pay more attention. 

However, I also found that there were several inconsistencies between the instruction code and the code provided (for example, in the instructions it says to create an updateMessagesInChatBox() function, but throughout the instructions only a updateMessages() function was referenced, which I think created a lot of confusion for me and obviously caused the program to not run correctly in the beginning. Also like the formatMessage() function called myNameInput const but in the instructions we were told to name the const nameInput, which, again, would cause the prorgam not to work correctly). I noticed this in some of the previous labs as well, so maybe this is something for the instructor to consider fixing throughout the remainder of the course.

// Storage:

This assignment was relatively easy, as it was eseentially just adding a new button and making it work to save the input to localStorage. 

### How long it took me to finish this?

4-5 hours. I could not figure out why the chatBox was not updating and did a lot of trial and error to fix it. 

// Storage: 

1.5 hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?

'display-4' sets the font size of an HTML element to be the largest among all 'display' classes and also applies a lighter font weight.
